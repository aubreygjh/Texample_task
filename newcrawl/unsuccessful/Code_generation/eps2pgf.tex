Eps2pgf_ is a PostScript interpreter that converts EPS figures to PGF code for 
inclusion in LaTeX documents. The author is `Paul Wagenaars`_. 

Eps2pgf_ is a Java command line tool. Here is an example on how to create a PGF version
of the well known PostScript tiger::

    $ java -jar eps2pgf.jar tiger.eps -o tiger.pgf

To display the tiger you have to include it in a LaTeX document:

.. sourcecode:: latex

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{pgf}
    \begin{document}
        \input{tiger.pgf}
    \end{document}

.. figure:: #eps2pgf1.png

The generated PGF code can be found in the file `tiger.pgf`_. 

The most interesting part of eps2pgf is that it allows you to replace text in the EPS figure with
arbitrary LaTeX markup. It is in fact an alternative to using tools like PSfrag_, and it is
even compatible with PSfrag_. See the documentation for more details. 

One application of eps2pgf is to annotate Matlab plots. Here is an example:

.. sourcecode:: matlab

    theta=0:0.05:5;
    y=sin(theta.^2);
    plot(theta,y);
    ylabel('\tex[cc][]{$y$}')
    xlabel('\tex[cc][]{$\theta$}')
    title('\tex[cc][]{$\sin\theta^2$}')
    text(1,0,'\tex{\LaTeX}')

The ``\tex{...}`` syntax allows you to insert raw LaTeX code in your figure. After you have
saved the above figure as an eps file, you can generate a pgf version using::

    $ java -jar eps2pgf.jar plot.eps -m directcopy -o plot.pgf

.. figure:: #eps2pgf2.png

You can find the generated pgf code in the file `plot.pgf`_. Matlab users may also
be interested in the script Mathfig2PGF_ written by eps2pgf's author. 

The output from eps2pgf is low level pgf commands. This can make it a bit difficult to modify
the generated code and to use higher level TikZ commands. The tool seems to be actively 
developed, so I am sure that future version will offer tighter integration with TikZ.
